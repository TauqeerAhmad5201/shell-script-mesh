# shell-script-mesh

Shell scripts have several required constructs that tell the shell environment what to do and when to do it. Of course, most scripts are more complex than the above one.

The shell is, after all, a real programming language, complete with variables, control structures, and so forth. No matter how complicated a script gets, it is still just a list of commands executed sequentially.

# echo the Hello World
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World"

# listing the file 
#!/bin/sh
ls
